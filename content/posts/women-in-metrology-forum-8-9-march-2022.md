Join to Metrology For All platform, The Coordinate Metrology Society's Women in Metrology committee, and other partners around the world including Amotech Africa, Fluke Corporation, IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society, and PTB in this two-day live forum celebrating International Women in Tech Day. This free online event, which kicks off on March 8, supports the development of a thriving metrology community of women scientists and engineers and promotes skills development for women interested in a career in metrology. It is our hope and intention that the example of these thought leaders will show girls and women with an interest in metrology that they can reach the very top of the field.
